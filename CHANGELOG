2020-06-19: Fabien Cuny
	(v0.9.8):
		- WebServer implementation done: GET, POST and AzuraCast modes implemented. Slides 
		and DLS monitoring implemented (documentation will come with next releases).
		- JSON parsing modification and adjustments.

2020-06-13: Fabien Cuny
	(v0.9.7):
		- Slight modification regarding default DLS sometimes not taken in account
		- Added User-Agent for source and cover checkings (because some servers don't like
		to be requested by scripts which are not browsers, and send 401 or 403 errors)
		- Slight modification regarding Timeout slide generation (wait of the html parsing
		implemented and added an <end></end> tag in the templates)
		- JSON parsing modification and adjustments
		- HTTP Server pre-work implementation in order to send artist title and cover URL via 
		GET and POST requests, also compatible with Azuracast. To be completed in next 
		releases.

	(v0.9.6):
		- DAB-CTL from V.Demarque (BCE) additional integration via _ext. To use this mode,
		please enable webserver in the DAB-CTL configuration and and allow "External 
		Control" mode of DLS and SLS. Use 'mode = dabctl-ext' in the PadTool config file.
		Complete your config file with this section relative to DAB-CTL:
			[dabctl-ext]
			hostname = 127.0.0.1    # DAB-CTL instance DNS or IP
			port = 8080             # Port of the DAB-CTL external webserver
			pi = FFB8               # PI subchannel defined in your DAB-CTL configuration
			passkey = 1234          # Eventually, the passkey you defined in DAB-CTL
		This mode is useful if PadTool is not run on the same system as the multiplexer
		(for eg. ODR-DabMux). Please note that this mode is not compatible with DLS+.
		- Fixed regression following several trials: managed timeout to image generation, 
		provided by the WebDriver.
		- Preparative work for Server Mode implementation.

2020-06-03: Fabien Cuny
	(v0.9.5):
		- Improved JSON parsing algorithm
		- Plugins integration bugfix
		- Possible to add gradient background to logo slide
		- DAB-CTL from V.Demarque (BCE) integration completely reworked. Works with DAB-CTL from
		version 4.0.11 for Logo, ATC slides, and plugin generated slides.
		To do so, please use the 'dabctl' mode, and allow "External Control" mode of DLS and SLS 
		in the DAB-CTL software (subchannel menu edition).
		- Faster image processing time within ChromeDriver, the wait times used for PhantomJS 
		are not useful anymore with ChromeDriver.

	(v0.9.4):
		- Automatic research for a cover, if not defined, can be enabled via the 
		[source]->researchCover parameter (0=disabled, 1=enabled) thanks to the CoverPy lib.
		Please see INSTALL in order to complete your installation.
		- Improved JSON parsing algorithm
		- DLS+ bugfix, not always generated when artistForm or titleForm parameters were used
		- Network fix: when a file (specified in [source]-> url) is not available due to
		network issues, or not found, PadTool tries to gather data from this file 5 times
		before being crashed. It avoids unexpected crashes.
		- Rework on plugins integration (calls each 5-10-15-30-60min)
		- First release with Unit Tests and Continuous Integration tests thanks to 
		PyTest and Travis CI included from this release (first batch of tests)

2020-05-01: Fabien Cuny
	(v0.9.3):
		- Json parser modification: several trials didn't work as expected, especially if
		the information about artist and title were in the first json item.
		- New feature: artist and title strings can be formated independently, with the 
		artistForm and titleForm parameters in the [general] section by using the following
		arguments:
			* 0 (by default): The string is as provided by the source file
			* 1: The string is entirely lowercase
			* 2: The string is entirely UPPERCASE
			* 3: The First Character Of Each Word Are Uppercase, While The Others Are Lowercase
		- DLS(+) generation code reworked and optimized
		- DLS(+): default DLS can be personnalized instead of "$radioName, $slogan" by using
		the [dls]->defaultDls parameter in the config file. When this option is not mentioned in 
		the config file, the defaultDls is "$radioName, $slogan"
		- Better integration for future plugins
		- Minor bugfix: DLS are generated with the default DLS (by default "$radioName, $slogan")
		when the artist and title tags are found in the template but not in the source file.

2020-02-11: Fabien Cuny
	(v0.9.2):
		Bugfixes :
		- Changed the way of logo slide generation (which could cause crashes with absolute paths)
		- Changed options in ChromeDriver usage to prevent Chrome failures in certain cases
		- In standalone mode, DLS and Slides were regenerated if artist and title were the same
		(reduces files generations and ChromeDriver calls). This part has to be optimized 
		in the future

2020-02-10: Fabien Cuny
	(v0.9.1):
		- Json Parser stills in beta, but seems to work pretty well, as i've got many
		positive feedbacks :-)
		- Rework on ChromeDriver usage : some issues were produced by the driver and slides
		weren't correctly generated after a couple of hours. 
		Bugs were amplified with supervisor (many ChromeDriver processes were thrown and 
		caused instabilities).

2020-01-27: Fabien Cuny
	(v0.9.0):
		- Huge rework on Json parsing files : Able now to parse variable json sized files.
		Actually in testing phase, because there is a lot of cases to think about.
		Please post an issue if you encounter problems.
		- Usage of ChromeDriver instead of PhantomJS which is deprecated. Please see INSTALL
		in order to complete your installation.
		- Modified slide generation processing in order to be fully compatible with ChromeDriver
		- Added date/time in the output.
		- Deletion of the residual ATC slide when none of the tags are found or filtered
		- Nice-to-have : Creation of the "out" directory when cloning this repository in order to
		launch examples without errors

2020-01-15: Fabien Cuny
	(v0.8.0):
		- Happy new year 2020, full of digital radio ! :-)
		- Added DAB-CTL mode in order to be fully compatible with the "DAB Control Interface" 
		software from V. Demarque (BCE)
		- DLS car now be generated outside the SLS directory if specified
		- DLS can be generated with or without DLS+ (DLS by default)
		Bugfixes :
			- Music (or ATC) slide generation crashed randomly. Wait time added in order 
			to complete the generation process.
			- Code optimization regarding proxy support and slide generation (no more temporary 
			files used anymore)
			- Under Linux distributions, the default cover did not appear when a cover URL 
			is pointing to an unexisting path.

2019-12-17: Fabien Cuny
	(v0.7.3):
		Accentuated characters are now supported in the slideshows
		Fixed : Default cover is now shown when an URL of a cover is dead or incorrect

2019-12-16: Fabien Cuny
	(v0.7.2):
		Regression Fixed : image generation caused sometimes black images. Now solved.
		Fixed : Covers and background hosted on HTTPS servers now fully appear 

2019-12-16: Fabien Cuny

		Bugfix concerning text files containing accents
		DLS+ text encoding fixed

		First pre-release, fixed bugs with generation of black slides
		Known-bug : problem with accents in the DLS crashes the program
