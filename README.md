Overview
========

PadTool is a MOT SLS and DLS generator for PAD encoders such as ODR-PadEnc.

PadTool is able to read json, xml, txt or html files and outputs DLS+ text
from these informations and generates nice SLS with personnalized templates

PadTool is better to use with the ODR-mmbTools tool set, especially with ODR-PadEnc.
